## System Design

### 1. How would you describe the architecture of SecureShare?
**Answer:**
SecureShare follows a client-server architecture with these key components:
- **Frontend**: React.js with Redux for state management
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- **Cache & Message Broker**: Redis for caching and task queuing
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with Django's FileSystemStorage
- **Background Processing**: Celery workers for async tasks
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent environments

The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, with clear separation of concerns between different components.

### 2. How does the system handle file uploads and downloads securely?
**Answer:**
- **Uploads**:
  - Files are validated for type and size on the client and server
  - Chunked uploads for large files to prevent timeouts
  - Temporary storage with unique filenames to prevent path traversal
  - Background processing for virus scanning (if implemented)
  - Metadata extraction and storage

- **Downloads**:
  - Secure signed URLs with expiration
  - Access control checks on each download request
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Download logging for audit purposes
  - Optional password protection for shared links

## Authentication & Authorization

### 3. How is authentication implemented in SecureShare?
**Answer:**
SecureShare uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication:
- Access and refresh token pattern
- Token-based authentication for API endpoints
- Secure cookie-based token storage
- Token blacklisting for logout functionality
- Token expiration and automatic refresh
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Secure password hashing using Argon2

### 4. How does the role-based access control (RBAC) work?
**Answer:**
- **Roles**:

## Security

### 7. What security measures are in place to protect files?
**Answer:**

  - status

- **FileVersions Table**:
  - id (UUID)
  - file_id (FK to Files)
  - version_number
  - created_at
  - created_by (FK to Users)
